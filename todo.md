## Task Objective
- Develop a desktop application "AI Character Council" for speculative fiction authors to manage complex characters and storylines across multiple novels

## Steps

### 1. Application Architecture Design - [Process Step]
- [x] 1. Define technical architecture (desktop framework, database, API structure)
- [x] 2. Create data models for characters, conversations, timelines, and notes
- [x] 3. Select appropriate LLM integration approach for character personalities
- [!] 4. Design system for persistent character memory and evolution (memory system completed, evolution system pending)
- [!] 5. Establish development environment and project structure (pending implementation)

### 2. AI Character Engine Development - [Process Step]
- [ ] 1. Develop character personality engine with customizable traits and worldviews
- [ ] 2. Implement dynamic memory system for tracking character knowledge
- [ ] 3. Create conversation system between author and AI characters
- [ ] 4. Build memory manipulation features (forgetting/recalling specific events)
- [ ] 5. Implement character evolution algorithms based on interactions
- [ ] 6. Develop character persistence and serialization mechanisms

### 3. Character Management System - [Process Step]
- [ ] 1. Create comprehensive character sheet interface with customizable attributes
- [ ] 2. Implement tagging and tracking system for character versions
- [ ] 3. Build tools for transformation tracking (reincarnations, alternate realities)
- [ ] 4. Develop character arc visualization components
- [ ] 5. Create relationship mapping functionality between characters
- [ ] 6. Implement "character roundtable" feature for multi-character discussions

### 4. Creative Writing Utilities - [Process Step]
- [ ] 1. Design and implement timeline visualization tool
- [ ] 2. Create reincarnation/transformation mapping visualizer
- [ ] 3. Develop cross-referenced note system with tagging
- [ ] 4. Build search and filter system for symbols, phrases, settings, and motifs
- [ ] 5. Create export modules for Word, Obsidian, and Scrivener
- [ ] 6. Implement automated backup and versioning system

### 5. User Interface Design - [Process Step]
- [ ] 1. Create detailed UI wireframes for all application components
- [ ] 2. Design fluid, intuitive interaction patterns for character conversations
- [ ] 3. Develop main application dashboard
- [ ] 4. Implement Character Council interface with conversation capabilities
- [ ] 5. Build Character Management interface with visual elements
- [ ] 6. Create interfaces for all creative writing utilities

### 6. Application Implementation - [Process Step]
- [ ] 1. Implement core desktop application framework
- [ ] 2. Build database and persistence layer
- [ ] 3. Integrate LLM technologies for character simulation
- [ ] 4. Develop UI components following design specifications
- [ ] 5. Implement data visualization components
- [ ] 6. Create export and interoperability features

### 7. Testing and Refinement - [Process Step]
- [ ] 1. Conduct usability testing with sample author workflows
- [ ] 2. Test LLM performance and character consistency
- [ ] 3. Verify data persistence and export functionality
- [ ] 4. Optimize application performance
- [ ] 5. Address issues with character memory coherence
- [ ] 6. Refine UX based on testing feedback

### 8. Documentation and Deployment - [Report Writing Step]
- [ ] 1. Create comprehensive user documentation
- [ ] 2. Develop tutorials for each major feature
- [ ] 3. Write technical documentation for future maintenance
- [ ] 4. Prepare installation and setup guides
- [ ] 5. Package application for distribution
- [ ] 6. Create update and maintenance mechanisms
