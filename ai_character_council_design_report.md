## 2. Technical Architecture

### Desktop Application Framework

The AI Character Council will be built as a cross-platform desktop application using **Electron.js**. This framework was selected for its:

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Modern web technologies**: Allows rich UI development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Native capabilities**: Provides access to file system, local storage, and system integration
- **Large ecosystem**: Offers extensive libraries and community support
- **Update mechanisms**: Includes built-in capabilities for auto-updates

Alternative frameworks considered included Qt/QML (better performance but higher development complexity), Flutter Desktop (promising but less mature for complex desktop applications), and Python with PyQt/Tkinter (easier LLM integration but more limited UI capabilities).

### Database Architecture

For data persistence, the application will use **SQLite with Prisma ORM**:

- **SQLite**: An embedded database perfect for desktop applications with no server requirements
- **Prisma ORM**: A type-safe database client with excellent TypeScript/JavaScript integration
- **Migration system**: For handling schema updates across application versions

This combination provides the ideal balance for a desktop application requiring complex relational data without an external server. The database will support local file storage with regular auto-backups, export/import functionality, versioned schema migrations, and JSON export options for interoperability.

### LLM Integration 

The application will implement a **hybrid local/cloud model** for LLM integration:

- **Local embedding models** for memory and knowledge indexing, semantic search retrieval, determining memory relevance, basic offline functionality, and pre/post-processing
- **Cloud-based LLMs** (primarily OpenAI GPT-4 or later) for character dialogue generation, complex personality expression, and creative content generation
- **Secondary and fallback options** including Anthropic Claude and local Mistral or Llama models for offline operation

This hybrid approach balances quality, cost, and privacy concerns while providing authors with sophisticated character interactions.
